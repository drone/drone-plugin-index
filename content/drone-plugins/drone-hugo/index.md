The Hugo plugin automatically generates static web page files, which can be published afterwards!

The example below demonstrates how you can use the plugin to automatically create static web page files using Hugo plugin:

```yml
pipeline:
  hugo:
    image: plugins/hugo:latest
    validate: true
```

`validate` allows you to check your configuration file for errors before generating the files.

#### Customize source, output, theme, config, layout OR content directory paths

You can customize the paths for e. g. the theme, layout, content directory and output directory and much more!

```yml
pipeline:
  hugo:
    image: plugins/hugo:latest
+   config: path/to/config
+   content: path/to/content/
+   layout: path/to/layout
+   output: path/to/public
+   source: path/to/source
+   theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
    validate: true
```

#### Set hostname (and path) to the root

You can also define a base URL directly in the pipeline, which is used when generating the files.

```yml
pipeline:
  hugo:
    image: plugins/hugo:latest
    config: path/to/config
    content: path/to/content/
    output: path/to/public
    source: path/to/source
    theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
+   url: https://drone-plugins.de
    validate: true
```

#### Build sites and include expired, drafts or future content

You can set the `buildDrafts`, `buildExpired`, `buildFuture` settings to configure the generated files.

- `buildDrafts` - include content marked as draft
- `buildExpired` - include expired content
- `buildFuture` - include content with publishdate in the future

```yml
pipeline:
  hugo:
    image: plugins/hugo:latest
+   buildDrafts: true
+   buildExpired: tru
+   buildFuture: true
    config: path/to/config
    content: path/to/content/
    output: path/to/public
    source: path/to/source
    theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
    url: https://drone-plugins.de
    validate: true
```

#### **Example**: Generate Hugo static files and publish them to remote directory using scp

Here is a short example of how to define a pipeline that automatically generates the static web page files with Hugo and then copies them to a remote server via scp. This makes publishing websites a breeze!

```yml
pipeline:
  build:
    image: plugins/hugo:latest
    output: public/drone-generated # Output path
    validate: true
    when:
      branch: [ master ]
  publish:
    image: appleboy/drone-scp
    # secrets: [ Use secrets to hide credentials! ]
    host: drone-plugins.de
    username: webuser
    password: xxxxxxx
    port: 54321
    rm: true
    target: /var/www/blog
    source: public/drone-generated/* # All files from output path

```
