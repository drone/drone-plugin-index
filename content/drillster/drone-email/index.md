The email plugin can be used to notify people of a build result.

The example configuration below will send an email to the build's author and the configured `recipients` (the-admin@your-domain.com and octocat@your-domain.com) when a build result changes or when it fails.
It will use the `username` and `password` to connect to `host` and send emails from `from`.
```yaml
steps:
  - name: notify
    image: drillster/drone-email
    settings:
      host: smtp.some-server.com
      username: foo
      password: bar
      from: drone@your-domain.com
    when:
      status: [ changed, failure ]
```

You can have the plugin send mails to a pre-configured list of `recipients` by default:

```diff
steps:
  - name: notify
    image: drillster/drone-email
    settings:
      host: smtp.some-server.com
      username: foo
      password: bar
      from: drone@your-domain.com
+     recipients: [ the-admin@your-domain.com, octocat@your-domain.com ]
    when:
      status: [ changed, failure ]
```

If you do not want to send a mail to the build's author (but only to `recipients`), use the `recipients_only` parameter:

```diff
steps:
  - name: notify
    image: drillster/drone-email
    settings:
      host: smtp.some-server.com
      username: foo
      password: bar
      from: drone@your-domain.com
      recipients: [ the-admin@your-domain.com, octocat@your-domain.com ]
+     recipients_only: true
    when:
      status: [ changed, failure ]
```

You can optionally attach a file to the sent mail(s) by setting the `attachment` parameter to the path of a file. It's possible to use a relative path (relative to the drone working directory). 

```diff
steps:
  - name: notify
    image: drillster/drone-email
    settings:
      host: smtp.some-server.com
      username: foo
      password: bar
      from: drone@your-domain.com
+     attachment: build-result.xml
    when:
      status: [ changed, failure ]
```

Should you want to skip SMTP server certificate verification, use the `skip_verify` parameter:

```diff
steps:
  - name: notify
    image: drillster/drone-email
    settings:
      host: smtp.some-server.com
+     skip_verify: true
      username: foo
      password: bar
      from: drone@your-domain.com
    when:
      status: [ changed, failure ]
```
