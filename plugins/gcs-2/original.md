The Google Cloud Storage plugin uploads files and build artifacts to your
Google Cloud Storage bucket. The below pipeline configuration demonstrates
simple usage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  gcs:
    image: wyattjoh/drone-gcs
    acl: public
    bucket: "my-bucket-name"
    source: public/**/*
    strip_prefix: public/
    target: /target/location
```

Enable compression:

```diff
pipeline:
  gcs:
    image: wyattjoh/drone-gcs
    acl: public
    bucket: "my-bucket-name"
    source: public/**/*
    strip_prefix: public/
+   compress: true
    target: /target/location
```

Exclude files from upload:

```diff
pipeline:
  gcs:
    image: wyattjoh/drone-gcs
    acl: public
    bucket: "my-bucket-name"
    source: public/**/*
    strip_prefix: public/
    target: /target/location
+   exclude:
+     - **/*.xml
```
