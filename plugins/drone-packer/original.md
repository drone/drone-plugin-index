This plugin can build automated machine images with [Packer](https://www.packer.io/). The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
    actions: build
```

To validate template file before building the machine images

```diff
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
-   actions: build
+   actions:
+     - validate
+     - build
```

A map of variables to pass to the Packer `build` commands. Each value is passed as a `<key>=<value>` option

```diff
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
    actions: build
+   vars:
+     aws_region: ap-southeast-1
+     app_version: 1.0.0
```

A list of var files to use. Each value is passed as -var-file=<value>:

```diff
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
    actions: build
+   var_files:
+     - foo.json
+     - bar.json
```

validate or build all builds other than these

```diff
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
    actions: build
+   except:
+     - foo
+     - bar
```

validate or build only the specified builds

```diff
pipeline:
  packer:
    image: appleboy/drone-packer
    template: aws.json
    actions: build
+   only:
+     - foo
+     - bar
```
