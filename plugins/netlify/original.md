The netlify plugin deploy your build to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com).

The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage to deploy the current working directory:

```yaml
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
    token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
```

Example configuration for assigning [Netlify subdomain](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/):

```diff
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
    token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
+   site_name: my-deployment-alias
```

Example configuration with [Custom domain](https://www.netlify.com/docs/custom-domains/):

```diff
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
    token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
-   site_name: my-deployment-alias
+   domain: my-custom-domain.com
```

Example configuration for specifying [environment](https://www.netlify.com/docs/continuous-deployment/#deploy-contexts):

```diff
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
    token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
-   domain: my-custom-domain.com
+   environment: production
```

Example configuration to deploy a specific folder or Zip (default current working directory):

```diff
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
    token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
-   environment: production
+   path: ./dist
```

Example configuration using token from secrets:

```diff
pipeline:
  netlify:
    image: lucap/drone-netlify
-   token: xxxxx
    site_id: xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxxx
+   secrets: [ netlify_token ]
