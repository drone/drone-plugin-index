The Now plugin deploy your build to [now.sh](https://zeit.co/now).

The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

Note: `deploy_name` is an optional parameter. If it is not given now.sh will use name of the working directory .

```yaml
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    now_token: keep-this-secret
```

Or use the secret NOW_TOKEN instead, if you supply both the plugin will use the `now_token` parameter first

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
-   now_token: keep-this-secret
+   secrets: [ now_token ]
```

Set the directory you want to deploy. See the [Deployment Documentation](https://zeit.co/docs/getting-started/deployment#) for more info.

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
+   directory: public
```

Example configuration with team scope:

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
-   directory: public
+   team: myteam
```


Example configuration to enforce type (by default, it's detected automatically):

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
-   team: myteam
+   type: npm
```

Example configuration for assigning [Aliases and Domains](https://zeit.co/docs/features/aliases):

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
-   type: npm
+   alias: my-deployment-alias
```

Example configuration for [Cleaning Up Old Deployments](https://zeit.co/docs/other/faq#how-do-i-remove-an-old-deployment):

Note: You must set the `alias` parameter with `cleanup`.

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
+   alias: my-deployment-alias
+   cleanup: true
```

Example configuration with custom [Path Aliases](https://zeit.co/docs/features/path-aliases):

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
-   alias: my-deployment-alias
-   cleanup: true
+   rules_domain: example.com
+   rules_file: rules.json
```

Example configuration for [Scaling](https://zeit.co/docs/getting-started/scaling):

```diff
pipeline:
  now:
    image: lucap/drone-now
    deploy_name: deployment-name
    secrets: [ now_token ]
-   rules_domain: example.com
-   rules_file: rules.json
+   scale: 2
```
