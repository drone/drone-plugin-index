  Our Drone plugin enables the ability for your pipeline to interface with
  Cloudflare's API to purge cache. This plugin is written in Go and it uses the
  [cloudflare-go](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go) package to
  communicate with Cloudflare's API. For information on Cloudflare's API please
  refer to their
  [documentation](https://api.cloudflare.com/#zone-purge-all-files) page.
