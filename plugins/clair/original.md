The Clair plugin submits your docker image to your [Clair](https://github.com/coreos/clair)
server to scan your docker image for security vulnerabilities.

The below pipeline configuration demonstrates simple usage:

```yaml
pipeline:
  clair:
    image: jmccann/drone-clair:1
    url: http://clair.company.com
    username: johndoe
    password: mysecret
    scan_image: python:2.7
```

To verify https/ssl connections with a different CA certificate use `ca_cert`

```diff
pipeline:
  clair:
    image: jmccann/drone-clair:1
    url: http://clair.company.com
    username: johndoe
    password: mysecret
    scan_image: python:2.7
+   ca_cert: |
+     -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
+     MII...
+     -----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

# Secrets

Instead of configuring sensitive information in your `.drone.yml` file in
plain text you can use Drone secrets and substitute the values at runtime using
string replacement.

Please see the Drone [documentation]({{< secret-link >}}) to learn more about secrets.

```diff
pipeline:
  clair:
    image: jmccann/drone-clair:1
    url: http://clair.company.com
-   username: johndoe
-   password: mysecret
+   username: ${DOCKER_USERNAME}
+   password: ${DOCKER_PASSWORD}
    scan_image: python:2.7
```
