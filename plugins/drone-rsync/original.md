The rsync plugin can be used to transfer files to remote machines, and run a user-defined script afterwards.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: deploy
    image: drillster/drone-rsync
    settings:
      hosts: [ "server-prod1", "server-prod2" ]
      source: ./target
      target: ~/packages
      include: [ "app.jar", "app.jar.md5" ]
      script:
        - cd ~/packages
        - md5sum -c app.jar.md5
```

The `user` attribute defines the user that will login on the remote machines and execute the defined script.

```diff
steps:
  - name: deploy
    image: drillster/drone-rsync
    settings:
      hosts: [ "server-prod1", "server-prod2" ]
+     user: foobar
      source: ./target
      target: ~/packages
      include: [ "app.jar", "app.jar.md5" ]
      exclude: [ "**.*" ]
      script:
        - cd ~/packages
        - md5sum -c app.jar.md5
```

The `key` attribute specifies the private key to use when setting up secure connections to the remote machines.

```diff
steps:
  - name: deploy
    image: drillster/drone-rsync
    settings:
      hosts: [ "server-prod1", "server-prod2" ]
+     key: "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ...."
      source: ./target
      target: ~/packages
      include: [ "app.jar", "app.jar.md5" ]
      exclude: [ "**.*" ]
      script:
        - cd ~/packages
        - md5sum -c app.jar.md5
```
