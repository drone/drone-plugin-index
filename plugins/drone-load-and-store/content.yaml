  This plugin can be used to load and publish images to the Docker registry. It
  can come in handy when the [default Docker
  plugin](http://plugins.drone.io/drone-plugins/drone-docker/) cannot be used. A
  good example usecase is [building Docker images with
  nix](https://nix.dev/tutorials/building-and-running-docker-images.html) which
  produces a Docker image archive.
