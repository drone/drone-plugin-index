The Hugo plugin automatically generates static web page files, which can be published afterwards!

The example below demonstrates how you can use the plugin to automatically create static web page files using Hugo plugin:

```yml
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: plugins/hugo
  settings:
    hugo_version: 0.55
    validate: true
```

`validate` allows you to check your configuration file for errors before generating the files.

#### Customize source, output, theme, config, layout OR content directory paths

You can customize the paths for e. g. the theme, layout, content directory and output directory and much more!

```yml
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: plugins/hugo
  settings:
    hugo_version: 0.55
    url: https://foo.com
+   config: path/to/config
+   content: path/to/content/
+   layout: path/to/layout
+   output: path/to/public
+   source: path/to/source
+   theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
    validate: true
```

#### Set hostname (and path) to the root

You can also define a base URL directly in the pipeline, which is used when generating the files.

```yml
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: plugins/hugo
  settings:
    hugo_version: 0.55
    url: https://foo.com
    config: path/to/config
    content: path/to/content/
    layout: path/to/layout
    output: path/to/public
    source: path/to/source
    theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
+   url: https://foo.com
    validate: true
```

#### Build sites and include expired, drafts or future content

You can set the `buildDrafts`, `buildExpired`, `buildFuture` settings to configure the generated files.

- `buildDrafts` - include content marked as draft
- `buildExpired` - include expired content
- `buildFuture` - include content with publishdate in the future

```yml
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: plugins/hugo
  settings:
    hugo_version: 0.55
    url: https://foo.com
    config: path/to/config
    content: path/to/content/
    layout: path/to/layout
    output: path/to/public
    source: path/to/source
    theme: path/themes/THEMENAME/
    url: https://foo.com
+   buildDrafts: true
+   buildExpired: true
+   buildFuture: true
    validate: true
```

#### **Example**: Generate Hugo static files and publish them to remote directory using scp

Here is a short example of how to define a pipeline that automatically generates the static web page files with Hugo and then copies them to a remote server via scp. This makes publishing websites a breeze!

```yml
kind: pipeline
name: default

steps:
- name: build
  image: plugins/hugo
  settings:
    hugo_version: 0.55
    pull: always
    url: https://foo.com
    validate: true

- name: deploy
  image: appleboy/drone-scp
  settings:
    host: 192.168.162.1
    target: /var/www/site
    source: public/*
    username:
      from_secret: ssh_username
    password:
      from_secret: ssh_password
    port:
      from_secret: ssh_port
  when:
    branch:
    - master
    event:
      exclude:
      - pull_request
```
