  This terraform plugin bundles a bunch of operations. It will pull the state from the remote backend
  or the harness db entry attached to the stack. Then it will retrieve the workflow operation and perform 
  `plan` or `plan -destroy` depending of the workflow. 
  Once the plan has been created, it will generate a json format of the plan
  and will send the plan raw and the plan as json format to the IAC server for analysis.
